# TfNSW GTFS Quirks
In an effort to turn my COVID-lockdown-induced obsession with the TfNSW GTFS feeds into something useful, I present: An unofficial collection of quirks I've noticed while using TfNSW's GTFS feeds.

I intend to tag releases when I notice something new or add to the info here, so if you'd like updates on that then watch releases on this repo.

## Disclaimer
Whilst every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, many of my conclusions are based solely on my own observations and may be incorrect. Much of the information contained in this repo also goes beyond the original intended use cases of the upstream data feeds and is subject to change at any time without notice. If you are looking to integrate TfNSW open data into your own project, conforming to the [official documentation](https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/documentation) as much as possible is recommended.
